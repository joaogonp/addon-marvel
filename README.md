## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **joaogonp**! I'm a newbie developer, and this is my first serious project. I've always been a huge Marvel fan, so I decided to create this addon to help others enjoy the MCU in the right chronological order.

I'm hosting the addon using **Render**, so the link might be offline for the first few seconds (Render's free tier suspends after inactivity). If that happens, please wait 1–2 minutes and reload — it should come online quickly!

## ✨ Features

- 🧬 **Chronological Order**: From *Captain America: The First Avenger* to *Secret Invasion* and beyond
- 🎬 **Movies & Series**: Includes Disney+ series like *Loki*, *WandaVision*, *Moon Knight*, and more
- 🌐 **Automatic Updates 1x per month**: Uses both OMDb and TMDb APIs to stay up-to-date with the latest releases
- 🚀 **Easy to Use**: Just install via URL inside Stremio

## 📦 Installation

1. Open Stremio  
2. Go to **Add-ons** → **Community Add-ons**  
3. Click **Install via URL**  
4. Paste the following URL:

   *(Note: If the link doesn't work right away, wait 1–2 minutes and reload the page. The Render server might be waking up!)*
